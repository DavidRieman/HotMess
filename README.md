# HotMess
A game where live people build a circuit by holding hands, or an occasional foot.

TODO: Need a really good description of the game, requirements, how to set it up, etc. Preferably with links to the original forum, etc.
* MaKey MaKey code and PC code. (Both required to play the game.)
* Both with "key compression scheme" to get around the max 6 simultaneous keys per keyboard HID limitation.
* Game should be fully playable and configurable.
* Note you can ground a pin during the configuration screen to help figure out how to map everything, during game setup.
